## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐    HTTP/JSON    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Website       │ ──────────────> │      CMS        │
│   (Port 3000)   │                 │   (Port 3001)   │
│                 │ <─────────────── │                 │
│ • React Pages   │   CORS Enabled  │ • REST APIs     │
│ • Search/Filter │                 │ • Database      │ 
│ • Responsive UI │                 │ • Admin Panel   │
└─────────────────┘                 └─────────────────┘
```

### **Data Flow**
1. **User visits website** → Page component loads
2. **Component calls dataService** → Transforms CMS data to legacy format
3. **dataService calls cmsApi** → Makes HTTP request to CMS
4. **CMS returns data** → Standardized JSON response
5. **Website displays content** → Real-time, searchable, filterable
